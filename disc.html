  <h1>Discovery process</h1>
  <p>The columns include some questions that could potentially prove or destroy
    some prejudices that we face everyday, and that is what I will focus on.
    I really enjoy the idea of looking at the correlation between 2 variables
    at a time, so my thought was to build a dynamic axis scatterplot linked with
    a time slider that changed over waves. Unfortunately, I did not have time
    to develop this, so the link I provide is basically a scatter plot. With
    some minor changes in the code, I was able to produce some plots.

  <p>We found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/fernandol/world-values-survey">this</a>
    link that already had some of the data formatted. After
    deleting the fields that had many null values, I found very interesting to
    compare most of the “justifiable” survey questions with some others about
    religion, gender inequality and more. Here are some examples that I found
    interesting:
